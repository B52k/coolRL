<h2>Kickoffs</h2>
<p>
    Every play in a Rocket League game begins with a kickoff, which makes it a rather important part of the game. Depending on how your kickoff goes, you may end up creating an early goal, or conceding one. Some aspects to consider when working on your kickoffs include:
</p>
    <ul> <!--this is hideous thanks to the centering-->
        <li>Coordination</li>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>direction</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    But today, I just want to talk about coordination. Coordination includes making quick decisions and communicating with your teammates. In a 3s (or standard) game, you need at least one person to attack the ball and one to defend the goal, which leaves the last person free to either fill up on boost or attempt to follow up the initial hit on the ball. 
</p>
<p>
    Of course, teams at different levels adopt different tactics. If you're confident in your kickoffs, you don't have to leave someone in front of goal. And sometimes it's helpful to send two on kickoffs. Or zero. But these are the basic roles, so let's fill them. On every kickoff, your car will spawn in one of five different places:
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="kickOne">1</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickTwo">2</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickThree">3</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickFour">4</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickFive">5</div>
</div>
<p>
    The spots marked "1" and "2" are closest to the ball (it may not look right like this, but it's true). "3" and "4" are in the middle, and "5" clearly, is furthest. 
</p>

   <p>In gold, you're going to start seeing players who can dribble. Dribbling, in Rocket League, specifically means carrying the ball on top of your car. I'm still working on it, but everyone says it just takes practice, so I try to do a little bit whenever I play. Some tips about dribbling:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Turn ball cam off, it's actually easier</li>
       <li>Start by popping it up when it's rolling toward you</li>
       <li>Or swipe through from the side</li>
       </ul>
<p> in free play, or use the "created" tab under custom training to set up a situation you want to practice, and just do it. It's gonna take a little bit. By dribbling, you make yourself, a smaller, more elusive target for defenders to catch, and you can flick.</p>

<p>Flicking is something you can do from a dribble. A flick is basically just a flip with the ball on top of the car. You can use it to launch the ball forward high, or pop it up above you. You can flip in any direction to flick, and it, plus the placement of the ball on your hood, will determine the arc of the move. Flicks are cool!</p>
