<h2>Kickoffs</h2>
<p>
    Every play in a Rocket League game begins with a kickoff, which makes it a rather important part of the game. Depending on how your kickoff goes, you may end up creating an early goal, or conceding one. Some aspects to consider when working on your kickoffs include:
</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>Coordination</li>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>direction</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    But today, I just want to talk about coordination. Coordination includes making quick decisions and communicating with your teammates. In a 3s (or standard) game, you need at least one person to attack the ball and one to defend the goal, which leaves the last person free to either fill up on boost or attempt to follow up the initial hit on the ball. 
</p>
<p>
    Of course, teams at different levels adopt different tactics. If you're confident in your kickoffs, you don't have to leave someone in front of goal. And sometimes it's helpful to send two on kickoffs. Or zero. But these are the basic roles, so let's fill them. On every kickoff, your car will spawn in one of five different places:
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="kickOne">1</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickTwo">2</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickThree">3</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickFour">4</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickFive">5</div>
</div>
<p>
    The spots marked "1" and "2" are closest to the ball (it may not look right like this, but it's true). "3" and "4" are in the middle, and "5" clearly, is furthest. We can use this information to judge kickoff assignments.
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="exOne">1</div>
    <div class="car" id="exTwo">2</div>
    <div class="car" id="exThree">3</div>
</div>

<p>
    In the example above, the car marked "1" is in position 1, and so that player should attack the ball. "3" is closest to the goal, so should stay, leaving "2" free to follow up or collect boost. But it's not always that simple. 
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="tieOne">1</div>
    <div class="car" id="tieTwo">2</div>
    <div class="car" id="tieThree">3</div>
</div>
<p>
    Here, the two forward cars are equidistant from the ball. And a lot of times, both these players will go for the ball. They'll get in each other's way, end up out of position, it becomes a mess. Which is why coordination is important. WHile "solo queuing," meaning playing outside a party with unknown teammates, the only way to coordinate is with quick chats. You only get a few seconds to decide, but you can use the team-only quickchats, which are accessed by pressing up on the d-pad on console. "Defending," "Take the shot" and "I got it!" are useful for suggesting you should go and who shouldn't. 
</p>
<p>
    But that still goes wrong a lot. Which is why a lot of people like to play with a regular group. You can be assured of the reliability of your teammates, get familiar with their tendencies, and voice chat while you play. When playing with a group, you can assign numbers to the roles. For instance, "1" might mean attacking the ball, "2" would be collecting boost or following-up, and "3" would be defending. You can rattle off those numbers quickly before each play. You can also figure out a priority list. For instance, if one of your group is clearly the best defender, you could decide that if there's a tie, that player should be the one to stay in goal. 
</p>
<p>
    Later, I'd love to talk about some of the mechanical things you can do to get to the ball quicker, and keep it from bouncing toward your goal. That'll come at another time. 
</p>

<h2>Dribbles and flicks</h2>
<p>
    In gold, you're going to start seeing players who can dribble. Dribbling, in Rocket League, specifically means carrying the ball on top of your car. I'm still working on it, but everyone says it just takes practice, so I try to do a little bit whenever I play. Some tips about dribbling:
</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Turn ball cam off, it's actually easier</li>
       <li>Start by popping it up when it's rolling toward you</li>
       <li>Or swipe through from the side</li>
       </ul>
<p> in free play, or use the "created" tab under custom training to set up a situation you want to practice, and just do it. It's gonna take a little bit. By dribbling, you make yourself, a smaller, more elusive target for defenders to catch, and you can flick.</p>

<p>Flicking is something you can do from a dribble. A flick is basically just a flip with the ball on top of the car. You can use it to launch the ball forward high, or pop it up above you. You can flip in any direction to flick, and it, plus the placement of the ball on your hood, will determine the arc of the move. Flicks are cool!</p>
