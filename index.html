<h2>Kickoffs</h2>
<p>
    Every play in a Rocket League game begins with a kickoff, which makes it a rather important part of the game. Depending on how your kickoff goes, you may end up creating an early goal, or conceding one.
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of things you can do to improve your speed and direction getting to the ball. That's a mechanical discussion. Today, I just want to talk about kickoff coordination. This includes making quick decisions and communicating with your teammates. In a 3s game, you need at least one person to attack the ball and one to defend the goal, which leaves the last person free to either fill up on boost or attempt to follow up the initial hit on the ball. 
</p>
<p>
    Of course, teams at different levels adopt different tactics. Teams that are confident int their recovering defense don't always leave someone there. And sometimes it's helpful to send two on kickoffs (mostly from the 1 and 2 spots). Or zero. But these are the basic roles, so let's fill them. On every kickoff, your car will spawn in one of five different places:
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="kickOne">1</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickTwo">2</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickThree">3</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickFour">4</div>
    <div class="car" id="kickFive">5</div>
</div>
<p>
    The spots marked "1" and "2" are closest to the ball (it may not look right like this, but it's true). "3" and "4" are in the middle, and "5" clearly, is furthest. We can use this information to judge kickoff assignments.
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="exOne">1</div>
    <div class="car" id="exTwo">2</div>
    <div class="car" id="exThree">3</div>
</div>

<p>
    In the example above, the car marked "1" is in position 1, and so that player should attack the ball. "3" is closest to the goal, so should stay, leaving "2" free to follow up or collect boost. But it's not always that simple. 
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="tieOne">1</div>
    <div class="car" id="tieTwo">2</div>
    <div class="car" id="tieThree">3</div>
</div>
<p>
    Here, the two forward cars are equidistant from the ball. And a lot of times, both these players will go for the ball. They'll get in each other's way, end up out of position, it becomes a mess. Which is why coordination is important. It's good to say what you're doing, but if you have rules, and stick to them, everyone should know what to do as soon as the cars spawn.
</p>
<p>
    One thing I suggest we do is apply numbers to the roles, like I've done when talking about offensive and defensive rotation. In my head, it makes sense for "1"  to mean attacking the ball, "2" should be collecting boost or following-up, and "3" is defending. Then, before each play, we just need to say "1, 2, 3" and we're ready. 
</p>
<p>
    We can also figure out a priority list. So if two people are in equivalent positions (such as 3 and 4), we can quickly decide who goes. It makes sense to me to have Xander furthest forward and Christian furtheest back in these. So our list might be:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Xander</li>
    <li>Ben</li>
    <li>Christian</li>
</ol>
<p>
    So any tie is resolved via this list. Even if it's not who's going. So if Xander is in the 1 spawn spot, and me and Christain are in 3 and 4, Christian would stay in goal and I would grab boost or follow up. 
</p>
<p>
    I know that agreeing upon kickoff rules will be good for us, but I'm not married to these ones. If you think we should do something different, let me know and I'll adjust this list post-haste. Later, I'd love to talk about some of the mechanical things you can do to get to the ball quicker, and keep it from bouncing toward your goal. But that'll come at another time. 
</p>

<h2>Dribbles and flicks</h2>
<p>
    In gold, you're going to start seeing players who can dribble. Dribbling, in Rocket League, specifically means carrying the ball on top of your car. I'm still working on it, but everyone says it just takes practice, so I try to do a little bit whenever I play. Some tips about dribbling:
</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Turn ball cam off, it's actually easier</li>
       <li>Start by popping it up when it's rolling toward you</li>
       <li>Or swipe through from the side</li>
       </ul>
<p> in free play, or use the "created" tab under custom training to set up a situation you want to practice, and just do it. It's gonna take a little bit. But by dribbling, you make yourself a smaller, more elusive target for defenders to catch, and you can flick.</p>

<p>Flicking is something you can do from a dribble. A flick is basically just a flip with the ball on top of the car. You can use it to launch the ball forward high, or pop it up above you. You can flip in any direction to flick, and it, plus the placement of the ball on your hood, will determine the arc of the move. Flicks are cool!</p>

<h2>Defensive Rotation</h2>
<p>
    This will be a rehash of two earlier cool RL tutorials. My early one on defense, and my more recent piece on off ball defense. Use this for review. 
</p>
<p>
    To end a defensive sequence, we have to get the ball moving away from our goal. A lot of the rules of defensive rotation come from that idea. For instance, it's how we know that you want to direct your clearances either upfield away from our goal or into our corner. Hitting the ball sideways into the wall or toward our own goal doesn't usually help, and should only be considered as the last man back in transition.
</p>
<p>
    So what should we do while defending? Well, we want to take turns attacking the ball while covering the rest of the field. In a situation where the opponent is heading down the sideline, it looks something like this.
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="defOne"></div>
     <div class="car" id="defTwo"></div>
    <div class="car" id="defThree"></div>
    <div class="car" id="orangeOnBall"></div>
    <div class="ball" id="dRotationBall"></div>
    <div class="car" id="orangeCenter"></div>
    <div class="car" id="orangeBack"></div>
    <div class="caption" id="bumpCap">On your way around, look to bump the center car</div>
    <div class="caption" id="backPostCap">rotate through the  back post, watch the cut back</div>
    <div class="caption" id="frontPostCap">Watch for the cross, wait for your teammate to challenge</div>
</div>

<p>
    Let's break that down a little bit. Of course, at any time, we need someone to challenge the ball. But we don't need everyone to do that at the same time, and we need to prepare for what happens if we miss. So we have guys on the posts. The back post guy watches the cut back, the front post guy blocks the cross. And we rotate through those positions one at a time. 
</p>
<p>
    So if I miss my challenge, I turn through the center, look to bump/demo the opponent in the middle, then spin through the back post. There, I'll watch out for the cut back, then move up through the front post when my teammate vacates that spot to challenge the ball. At the front post, I'll look to stop the cross, then move up to challenge the ball when it's my turn. If we can do that, then we can survive missed challenges and hold up on defense as long as we need to. 
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there are exceptions to these rules. Sometimes, on a challenge, the ball will switch sides and be picked up by a different opponent, and we'll need to reverse our rotation to cover it. Or the opponent will cut back, and the back post guy will need to come out to challenge, and we'll need to cover that. But mastering these basic rules is essential to improvement, so let's keep working on it!
</p>

<!--  
    I would love to fit another thing in here about offensive demo's. 
I'm going to throw in an essay I wrote a while ago about mechanics, just to keep it here. 
I think the next topic(s) for discussion involve taking the next step. This week, I think we discovered how high the gold 1 barrier can be. There’s a notable difference between silver teams and gold ones. You can feel it, but to put it into words, I’d talk about pace of play, point of impact, and familiarity with the game.

Pace of play is the simplest to explain, but also the vaguest. Better teams can turn defense into offense quicker, and vice versa. Matching that, I think, has a lot to do with simple comfort with the ball. Your pace of play will improve if you can hit the ball where you want, when you want. We need to be comfortable getting touches with the hood, wheels and bumper of the car, and with hitting the ball off the bounce, the roll, hit it off the wall, from the side, while jumping, while boosting, etc. 

The thing I do that I recommend is playing 1 v AI. There are a lot of different difficulty settings you can choose from to ramp up to your ability level. You can go rookie, pro or all star, and then there’s unfair, which will add 1 player to your opponent’s team. Then by changing the player numbers, you can go to 1 v 3 or 1 v 4. Playing without help will force to you to work on ball control, and playing against AI limits stress and frustration (you can listen to music or a podcast while doing it) and they’re not going to press you too hard, so you should have space to string touches together if you place them right. 

Point of impact is really a facet of pace of play, but its worth mentioning on its own. Better teams will hit the ball higher in the air. If you can’t match that, they’re going to go over your head. There’s not much I can say that can help with aerials, but I’ll try this: go higher than you need to, earlier than you need to, then angle the bumper down at the last minute. If you go too late, you’ll end up hitting the ball straight up if you get it at all. The aerials section of the training menu is one place to start working, but eventually you’ll need to practice in games. 

Lastly, by familiarity with the game, I basically mean this: so far, most of our goals have come via crosses through the corner, and counterattacks against open nets. When the opponents cover the near post and don’t give up open nets, we have a much worse time. So what do we do? Ultimately, we have to develop the kind of ball control that can beat a keeper. But that’s going to take a while. In the meantime, there are two things we can do.

One is mix up how we get from the corner to in front of the goal. Beating a contest int the corner and the man on the post already requires being a little more clever, but there’s some other stuff we can work in. You’ve seen me play ball off the flat part of the back wall, either as a pass or a dribble move, and you can also round the corner with the ball and play a direct pass. The timing on those is tighter, so it’ll take some practice, but it’s worth working on.

The other, option, which I’m a little scared to mention, is demo plays. If there’s a guy camped in the goal. You can just blast him. Try it next time you lose control of the ball. Say you’re rotating, turn off ball cam, and blast toward the nearest guy. Even if you don’t demo up, a well timed bump can wreak havoc on the opponent. Think of it as part of your rotation, you’re going to go from the demo/bump to the three spot 

Clearing to the corner.
