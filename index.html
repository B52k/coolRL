<h2>Kickoffs</h2>
<p>
    Every play in a Rocket League game begins with a kickoff, which makes it a rather important part of the game. Depending on how your kickoff goes, you may end up creating an early goal, or conceding one. Some aspects to consider when working on your kickoffs include:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coordination</li>
        <li>Speed</li>
        <li>direction</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    But today, I just want to talk about coordination. Coordination includes making quick decisions and communicating with your teammates. In a 3s (or standard) game, you need at least one person to attack the ball and one to defend the goal, which leaves the last person free to either fill up on boost or attempt to follow up the initial hit on the ball. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, teams at different levels adopt different tactics. If you're confident in your kickoffs, you don't have to leave someone in
front of goal. And sometimes it's helpful to send two on kickoffs. Or zero. But these are the basic roles, so let's fill them. 
On every kickoff, your car will spawn in one of five different places:
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="1-1">1</div>
    <div class="car" id="1-2">2</div>
    <div class="car" id="1-3">3</div>
    <div class="car" id="1-4">4</div>
    <div class="car" id="1-5">5</div>
</div>
