    <h2>Fast Aerials</h2>
    <p>
        When I watch high level players, I use this phrase a lot: "How are they that fast?" They're playing with the same cars, the same engines we are. To be honest, a lot of it is still a mystery to me. But not all of it! Because now I know about fast aerials, and soon, you will too. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A fast aerial is, predictably enough, a way to get into the air faster. Basically, you use your double jump to while you're elevating, and it'll give you a burst of acceleration. To see it in action, check out this <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcG02ik0EyU">tutorial</a> from Sunless Khan, whose Why You Suck at Rocket League series is highly recommended. The trick is that you can't be touching the control stick when you hit the jump button, otherwise you'll flip, which eats your momentum. So what you have to do is:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Jump</li>
        <li>Boost, while tipping back on the control stick to angle the car upward</li>
        <li>Let go of the control stick</li>
        <li>Tap the jump button</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Learning to do it is a little tricky, so I'd definitely start in training or local play before taking it online. What's harder, in my experience, is getting the timing down for hitting the ball after doing a fast aerial. I tend to overshoot my touches when I use it, so I mostly deploy it on defense, where the jump is low and it's easy to be too late. In those situations, I can wait until I know I'm not going to make it, then hit jump for that extra speed to make the save. It's pretty exciting when it happens, so I encourage you to practice fast aerials!

        P.S: Oh, hey, while I've got you, this is a convenient time to bring up a couple things. One is about the controller. I mentioned it before, and this video does too, but you should totally change your controls if you haven't already. Moving air roll and drift to l1 let's you boost and air roll/drift at the same time. This is super helpful for turning quickly and hitting aerials with particular parts of the ball. Make the change, pracitce it for an hour, and you'll be golden for the rest of your RL career.

        The other is about the flip timer. You've probably figured this out already, but once you jump, you only have a couple of seconds to use your flip, otherwise you lose it until you land. High level players have a couple ways to get around that, like flip resets and ceiling shots, which we are super not ready to try yet. But it's good to be aware of it.

<h2>Dribbles and flicks</h2>
<p>
    In gold, you're going to start seeing players who can dribble. Dribbling, in Rocket League, specifically means carrying the ball on top of your car. I'm still working on it, but everyone says it just takes practice, so I try to do a little bit whenever I play. Some tips about dribbling:
</p>
   <ul>
       <li>Turn ball cam off, it's actually easier</li>
       <li>Start by popping it up when it's rolling toward you</li>
       <li>Or swipe through from the side</li>
       </ul>
<p> in free play, or use the "created" tab under custom training to set up a situation you want to practice, and just do it. It's gonna take a little bit. But by dribbling, you make yourself a smaller, more elusive target for defenders to catch, and you can flick.</p>

<p>Flicking is something you can do from a dribble. A flick is basically just a flip with the ball on top of the car. You can use it to launch the ball forward high, or pop it up above you. You can flip in any direction to flick, and it, plus the placement of the ball on your hood, will determine the arc of the move. Flicks are cool!</p>
