    <h2>Offensive Rotation and O. Demo's</h2>
    <p>
        Offensive rotation is a little more complex than defense, which is mostly a big circle. So before I get into details, let's start with fundamental rules.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In 3s, someone has to defend the goal</li>
        <li>You shoot best when you have a run up to the ball</li>
        <li>Continuous offense is the best way to break down a defense</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If we accept these stipulations, you have a solid foundation for deriving the rules of rotation. If you're underneath the ball, you don't have the run up necessary to get a good shot. The guy defending the goal does, but he can't move until you turn back because someone has to defend the goal. But stay aware, because we want to follow up blocked shots, putting them back on frame or taking them back to the corner for another pass. This is only possible by switching positions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's talk about what this looks like in practice. The below is what's taught in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THcMLWOEc_o&list=PLrLBbJnregxcuuQY5kuMr73jZXBOqinat&index=9">Why You Suck at Rocket League </a> and its sources. The situation that video lays out is pretty familiar. It starts like this.
    </p>
    <div class="field">
        <div class="blue car offOne">1</div>
         <div class="blue car offTwo">2</div>
        <div class="blue car offThree">3</div>
        <div class="ball" id="oRotationBall"></div>
        <div class="orange car orangeChallenge"></div>
        <div class="orange car orangeFrontPost"></div>
        <div class="orange car orangeBackPost"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here, I've outlined three positions for the blue team, like I've done for defense and kickoffs. Here, 1 is the passer. 2 is the shooter. Three is the defender. In this situation, the cross is going to go long to the far side of the field. We want to pick it up there and get another cross in quickly. How do we do that?
    </p>
    <div class="field">
        <div class="blue car" id="crossOne"></div>
         <div class="blue car" id="crossTwo"></div>
        <div class="blue car" id="crossThree"></div>
        <div class="ball" id="crossBall"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Hey, we did it! The defender has the best read on the play and angle of attack, so he can cross the ball back in, and the original passer can try to finish it. And we still have someone in defense. But we should rotate this way more often than just on long crosses. If a guy is taking it up the wall and gets tackled or loses control, the defender should come in to try to pick it back up. And if a shot is saved, the defender should come in to take another shot or go back to the corner for another cross. The defender can see the play and get the right run up, so he's the best man to come in and take over on ball when something happens. If we can work this kind of rotation in smoothly, we'll be quicker and more sustainable on offense.
    </p>
    <p>
       One little thing: RL is fluid, no rules are unbreakable, and that's especially true on offense. In certain situations, the defender won't be available to come up. Maybe he's been demo'd, maybe he has to go back and get boost. If so, that person should let us know, and we can play it more like 2's (which is basically a circle) for that time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I've promised a demo play and intend to deliver. The danger here is committing too many people up front and falling victim to an open goal on the counter attack. So we have to pick our spots and communicate. In the situation I'm going to show you, the "passer" is going to take the ball all the way to the goal himself. Maybe the defense is rotating slowly, maybe we're running out of time, maybe he's just feeling confident. Either way, he doesn't need the shooter to shoot, which leaves him free to attack.
    </p>
    <div class="field">
        <div class="blue car" id="demoOne"></div>
         <div class="blue car" id="demoTwo"></div>
        <div class="blue car" id="demoThree"></div>
        <div class="orange car" id="orangeDemo"></div>
        <div class="ball" id="demoBall"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Hopefully, that scans. Once the shooter knows the passer's intention, he can get out in front. Here, we're hoping to use the cut back to beat the front post, so when the back post comes up to challenge, he takes him out, then turns back toward his own half. If the passer instead decided to send a short cross to himself or tap it against the back wall to himself, then the front post would be the target.
    </p>

    <h2>Defensive Rotation</h2>
<p>
    This will be a rehash of two earlier cool RL tutorials. My early one on defense, and my more recent piece on off ball defense. Use this for review. 
</p>
<p>
    To end a defensive sequence, we have to get the ball moving away from our goal. A lot of the rules of defensive rotation come from that idea. For instance, it's how we know that you want to direct your clearances either upfield away from our goal or into our corner. Hitting the ball sideways into the wall or toward our own goal doesn't usually help, and should only be considered as the last man back in transition.
</p>
<p>
    So what should we do while defending? Well, we want to take turns attacking the ball while covering the rest of the field. In a situation where the opponent is heading down the sideline, it looks something like this.
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="blue car" id="defOne"></div>
     <div class="blue car" id="defTwo"></div>
    <div class="blue car" id="defThree"></div>
    <div class="orange car" id="orangeOnBall"></div>
    <div class="ball" id="dRotationBall"></div>
    <div class="orange car" id="orangeCenter"></div>
    <div class="orange car" id="orangeBack"></div>
    <div class="caption" id="bumpCap">On your way around, look to bump the center car</div>
    <div class="caption" id="backPostCap">rotate through the  back post, watch the cut back</div>
    <div class="caption" id="frontPostCap">Watch for the cross, wait for your teammate to challenge</div>
</div>

<p>
    Let's break that down a little bit. Of course, at any time, we need someone to challenge the ball. But we don't need everyone to do that at the same time, and we need to prepare for what happens if we miss. So we have guys on the posts. The back post guy watches the cut back, the front post guy blocks the cross. And we rotate through those positions one at a time. 
</p>
<p>
    So if I miss my challenge, I turn through the center, look to bump/demo the opponent in the middle, then spin through the back post. There, I'll watch out for the cut back, then move up through the front post when my teammate vacates that spot to challenge the ball. At the front post, I'll look to stop the cross, then move up to challenge the ball when it's my turn. If we can do that, then we can survive missed challenges and hold up on defense as long as we need to. 
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there are exceptions to these rules. Sometimes, on a challenge, the ball will switch sides and be picked up by a different opponent, and we'll need to reverse our rotation to cover it. Or the opponent will cut back, and the back post guy will need to come out to challenge, and we'll need to cover that. But mastering these basic rules is essential to improvement, so let's keep working on it!
