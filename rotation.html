    <h2>Offensive Rotation and O. Demo's</h2>
    <p>
        Offensive rotation is a little more complex than defense, which is mostly a big circle. So before I get into details, let's start with fundamental rules.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In 3s, someone has to defend the goal</li>
        <li>You shoot best when you have a run up to the ball</li>
        <li>Continuous offense is the best way to break down a defense</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If we accept these stipulations, you have a solid foundation for deriving the rules of rotation. If you're underneath the ball, you don't have the run up necessary to get a good shot. The guy defending the goal does, but he can't move until you turn back because someone has to defend the goal. But stay aware, because we want to follow up blocked shots, putting them back on frame or taking them back to the corner for another pass. This is only possible by switching positions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's talk about some different scenarios. The first is what I'm going to call "standard rotation." This is what's taught in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THcMLWOEc_o&list=PLrLBbJnregxcuuQY5kuMr73jZXBOqinat&index=9">Why You Suck at Rocket League </a> and its sources. The situation that video lays out is pretty familiar. It starts like this.
    </p>
    <div class="field">
        <div class="car" id="offOne">1</div>
         <div class="car" id="offTwo">2</div>
        <div class="car" id="offThree">3</div>
        <div class="ball" id="oRotationBall"></div>
        <div class="car" id="orangeChallenge"></div>
        <div class="car" id="orangeFrontPost"></div>
        <div class="car" id="orangeBackPost"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here, I've outlined three positions for the blue team, like I've done for defense and kickoffs. Here, 1 is the passer. 2 is the shooter. Three is the defender. In this situation, the cross is going to go long to the far side of the field. We want to pick it up there and get another cross in quickly. How do we do that?
    </p>
    <div class="field">
        <div class="car" id="crossOne"></div>
         <div class="car" id="crossTwo"></div>
        <div class="car" id="crossThree"></div>
        <div class="ball" id="crossBall"></div>
    </div>

    <!--
        I think I want to focus on the ball over the head, which lets 2 go to 1 and 1 to 3. On a challenge, 3 takes, 1 goes to 3, 2 stays, is I think what Sunless says
    -->

    <h2>Defensive Rotation</h2>
<p>
    This will be a rehash of two earlier cool RL tutorials. My early one on defense, and my more recent piece on off ball defense. Use this for review. 
</p>
<p>
    To end a defensive sequence, we have to get the ball moving away from our goal. A lot of the rules of defensive rotation come from that idea. For instance, it's how we know that you want to direct your clearances either upfield away from our goal or into our corner. Hitting the ball sideways into the wall or toward our own goal doesn't usually help, and should only be considered as the last man back in transition.
</p>
<p>
    So what should we do while defending? Well, we want to take turns attacking the ball while covering the rest of the field. In a situation where the opponent is heading down the sideline, it looks something like this.
</p>
<div class="field">
    <div class="car" id="defOne"></div>
     <div class="car" id="defTwo"></div>
    <div class="car" id="defThree"></div>
    <div class="car" id="orangeOnBall"></div>
    <div class="ball" id="dRotationBall"></div>
    <div class="car" id="orangeCenter"></div>
    <div class="car" id="orangeBack"></div>
    <div class="caption" id="bumpCap">On your way around, look to bump the center car</div>
    <div class="caption" id="backPostCap">rotate through the  back post, watch the cut back</div>
    <div class="caption" id="frontPostCap">Watch for the cross, wait for your teammate to challenge</div>
</div>

<p>
    Let's break that down a little bit. Of course, at any time, we need someone to challenge the ball. But we don't need everyone to do that at the same time, and we need to prepare for what happens if we miss. So we have guys on the posts. The back post guy watches the cut back, the front post guy blocks the cross. And we rotate through those positions one at a time. 
</p>
<p>
    So if I miss my challenge, I turn through the center, look to bump/demo the opponent in the middle, then spin through the back post. There, I'll watch out for the cut back, then move up through the front post when my teammate vacates that spot to challenge the ball. At the front post, I'll look to stop the cross, then move up to challenge the ball when it's my turn. If we can do that, then we can survive missed challenges and hold up on defense as long as we need to. 
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there are exceptions to these rules. Sometimes, on a challenge, the ball will switch sides and be picked up by a different opponent, and we'll need to reverse our rotation to cover it. Or the opponent will cut back, and the back post guy will need to come out to challenge, and we'll need to cover that. But mastering these basic rules is essential to improvement, so let's keep working on it!
